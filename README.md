# SDG-XI Hackathon Project

This project is a submission for the SDG-XI Hackathon. It is a web application that helps users find the most fuel-efficient route between two points, thus contributing to the reduction of carbon emissions.

## Features

*   **Green Route Calculation**: The application uses a simulated AI model to find the most fuel-efficient route between two points.
*   **User-Friendly Interface**: The application provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to enter their origin and destination.
*   **Extensible**: The backend is designed to be extensible, allowing for the integration of a real AI model for more accurate fuel consumption predictions.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend**: React
*   **Backend**: Spring Boot, Java
*   **Mapping Service**: Google Maps API

## Getting Started

Please refer to the `Documentation.md` file for instructions on how to run the application.
